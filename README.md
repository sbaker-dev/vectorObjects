# vectorObjects
#### Object approach to common dimensional vectors 

As part of the [mmdParser][mmd] project of converting and extending the now archived [pymeshio][pymesh], a set of common
functions programmed as part of the pymeshio relating to Vectors and 3D object rotation matrices where extracted, and 
then generalised where possible. This was due to some of these objects also having the potential to be used outside of
this specific use case. vectorObjects also has the ability to allow you to create your own vectors, not pre defined
within vectorObjects, quickly via inheritance from a master class of methods.
